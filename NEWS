Changes in version 1.3.0

FIX: 'groups' argument in `test.bootSemNeT`

UPDATE: added integration of SemNetCleaner output into `SemNeTShiny`

MOVE: `equate` and `finalize` moved from SemNetCleaner to SemNeT

REMOVE: foreach and doParallel dependencies were removed (all parallelization is through the pbapply package)

REMOVE: SemNetCleaner dependency was removed to allow SemNeT to operate independently -- all necessary functions from SemNetCleaner have been moved to internal functions

UPDATE: `compare.nets` has changed to `compare_nets`

ADD: Several semantic network estimation methods (see `CN`, `NRW`, and `PF`) -- these are included in the Shiny app

CHANGE: `partboot` is now `bootSemNeT`

CHANGE: `plot.partboot` is now `plot.bootSemNeT`

CHANGE: `partboot.test` is now `test.bootSemNeT`

UPDATE: `cosine` was added to internal functions to remove archived package from dependencies


Changes in version 1.2.0

o ADD: Shiny app

o FIX: 'groups' argument in `org.plot`

o UPDATE: moved several functions to internal to clean up package

o ADD: binary responses matrices from animals verbal fluency data associated with the 'SemNetCleaner' package (open.animals)


Changes in version 1.1.3

o added extended ANOVA capabilities to `partboot.test` (e.g., two-way ANOVA)


Changes in version 1.1.2

o fixed bug for weighted modularity in `semnetmeas`

o updated citation (PsyArXiv)

o changed y-axis in plots for `partboot` to read as integers (as added black dot for mean in the scatterplots under the raincloud)

o added vignette for analyzing semantic networks

o added data for plots in vignette


Changes in version 1.1.1

o updated citation


Changes in version 1.1.0

o changed `semnetmeas` to allow calculation of any combination of measures

o `partboot`, `partboot.test`, `plot.partboot`, `randnet.test`, and `compare.nets` now handle groups greater than 2

o bug fixes


Changes in version 1.0.0

o serious, and I mean serious, revamp of functions (all for the better)

o moved most functions over to 'SemNetCleaner' and now only consists of methods and measures for semantic network analysis

o added a `sim.fluency` function for toy examples in CRAN checks

o added two datasets 'one.result' and 'two.result' for toy examples in CRAN checks

o `partboot.plot` changed to `plot.partboot` and added to S3 methods

o `partboot.test` now outputs a list for each network measure


Changes in version 0.9.9

o animals.database: a database for animals was added

o animals.misnomer: common misnomers for animals was added

o textcleaner: added database functionality, which makes the cleaning process more accurate, efficient, and reproducible

o several wrapper functions added to aid textcleaning from a database


Changes in version 0.1.2

o autoConverge: significantly improved interface

o separated all function files into individual files

o semnetcleaner (changed to textcleaner): added argument to input participants by row or column; ids now included for output; added output to show what spellcheck changed

o destr: improved functionality to allow selection of separating character

o randwalk: added a function to simulate random walks on the network to examine spontaenous spreading activation

o bin2resp: a function to change cleaned binary response data back into character data for each participant


Changes in version 0.1.1

o cosine: added cosine similarity

o semnetboot: changed name to partboot and added the cosine similarity

o semnetmeas: moved from NetworkToolbox

o plot.partboot: a function that generates "raindrop" plots for bootstrapped data

o org.plot: an organization function for plot.partboot (not for individual use)

o convert2cytoscape: added a function to convert a network matrix into a sparse matrix for Cytoscape visualization

o added new examples with corresponding data files


Changes in version 0.1.0

o autoConverge: created an automated converge function to eliminate the manual converge process

o autoDeStr: created an automated de-string function to eliminate most manual de-stringing

o fine-tuned most functions

o semnetboot: moved from package NetworkToolbox
