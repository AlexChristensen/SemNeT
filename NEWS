Changes in version 1.1.2

o fixed bug for weighted modularity in `semnetmeas`

o updated citation (PsyArXiv)

o changed y-axis in plots for `partboot` to read as integers (as added black dot for mean in the scatterplots under the raincloud)

o added vignette for analyzing semantic networks

o added data for plots in vignette


Changes in version 1.1.1

o updated citation


Changes in version 1.1.0

o changed `semnetmeas` to allow calculation of any combination of measures

o `partboot`, `partboot.test`, `plot.partboot`, `randnet.test`, and `compare.nets` now handle groups greater than 2

o bug fixes


Changes in version 1.0.0

o serious, and I mean serious, revamp of functions (all for the better)

o moved most functions over to 'SemNetCleaner' and now only consists of methods and measures for semantic network analysis

o added a `sim.fluency` function for toy examples in CRAN checks

o added two datasets 'one.result' and 'two.result' for toy examples in CRAN checks

o `partboot.plot` changed to `plot.partboot` and added to S3 methods

o `partboot.test` now outputs a list for each network measure


Changes in version 0.9.9

o animals.database: a database for animals was added

o animals.misnomer: common misnomers for animals was added

o textcleaner: added database functionality, which makes the cleaning process more accurate, efficient, and reproducible

o several wrapper functions added to aid textcleaning from a database


Changes in version 0.1.2

o autoConverge: significantly improved interface

o separated all function files into individual files

o semnetcleaner (changed to textcleaner): added argument to input participants by row or column; ids now included for output; added output to show what spellcheck changed

o destr: improved functionality to allow selection of separating character

o randwalk: added a function to simulate random walks on the network to examine spontaenous spreading activation

o bin2resp: a function to change cleaned binary response data back into character data for each participant


Changes in version 0.1.1

o cosine: added cosine similarity

o semnetboot: changed name to partboot and added the cosine similarity

o semnetmeas: moved from NetworkToolbox

o plot.partboot: a function that generates "raindrop" plots for bootstrapped data

o org.plot: an organization function for plot.partboot (not for individual use)

o convert2cytoscape: added a function to convert a network matrix into a sparse matrix for Cytoscape visualization

o added new examples with corresponding data files


Changes in version 0.1.0

o autoConverge: created an automated converge function to eliminate the manual converge process

o autoDeStr: created an automated de-string function to eliminate most manual de-stringing

o fine-tuned most functions

o semnetboot: moved from package NetworkToolbox
