o added data for plots in vignette


Changes in version 1.1.1

o updated citation


Changes in version 1.1.0

o `partboot`, `partboot.test`, `plot.partboot`, `randnet.test`, and `compare.nets` now handle groups greater than 2

o bug fixes


Changes in version 1.0.0

o serious, and I mean serious, revamp of functions (all for the better)

o moved most functions over to 'SemNetCleaner' and now only consists of methods and measures for semantic network analysis
